gr0wing Studio's API enable the creation and management of users on an NFT Marketplace: NFT creators, NFT buyers and NFT sellers.

Our API terminology breaks down users into two categories:

* Issuers: they are the NFT creators, those who upload media and request their minting into NFTs and sell them on a primary Market.
* Investors: investors are NFT buyers. They will also be able to sell their NFT on a secondary market.
