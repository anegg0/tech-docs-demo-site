### Asset

An asset can be any item of value, tangible or intangible (digital media or real-world asset). In the case of an image, the image itself is the asset, while an NFT is a unique token representing ownership of an instance of that asset.Assets ownership can be represented by one or many tokens (asset supply). Assets can be grouped or not. They are implemented using ERC-1155.

### Asset vs. token

Assets are items of value; tokens represent ownership of these items. Tokens can represent ownership of an asset or a fraction of that asset.

### Blind asset

The Core API abstracts away blockchain concepts,  enabling users to perform NFT related transactions (contract deployment, NFT collections minting, buys, sales) without dealing with the complexity of Blockchain.


### DATs Marketplace API

DATs Marketplace API enables creating and managing an NFT marketplace on an Ethereum blockchain using API restful calls. The benefit for the client is that they don't have to understand underlying DATs concepts and operations (issuers, investors) or blockchain logic to run a marketplace.On a functional level, DATs Marketplace exposes business-related API calls (users/vouchers) and interacts with DATs Back-Office back-end and DATs Core API.

### Issuer

An issuer is a person/entity that issues NFTs or collections. In other words, an issuer is a content creator. Issuers can be clients, who decide to issue their own NFTs, or any content creator associated with the client.e.g., if the client is a museum, the museum can issue their own NFTs or create issuer accounts for each of their collaborating artists and let them issue NFTs - Source: Daniel Vallecillo
