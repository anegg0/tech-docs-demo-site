As for the operations we can perform on the tokens, on the one hand, we can perform various operations to distribute (some involve cashing out others do not) the tokens in the primary market among investors. On the other hand, operations that an investor can perform on those tokens (previously acquired) in the secondary market, such as buying or selling.

- Distribution operations:
    - OTC subscription: Operation to transfer a token to an investment account and the payment or whatever that operation needs are done out of the system (for instance payment).

        Also, we have individual NFTS

        The user buys an NFT → Marketplace through Circle integration completes the payment process (out of the system) → Marketplace call CORE requesting an OTC subscription to put the token bough in the investor account → As a result the investor receives the token

    - Random collection OTC mint
    - Random collection mint → Random giveaway
    - Giveaway

- Put on sale a token owned by an investor
- Transfer a token owned by an investor to another one
- Withdraw a token owned by an investor
