# Tech Docs Demo Site

## Install

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Follow these steps to contribute to this developer site:

**Note:** You should use Node 16. If using `nvm`, type `nvm use` before installing.

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Testing the local site

```console
npm run serve
```
